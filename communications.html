                    <p>This system was far more efficient than anything seen before. Messages with detail could be sent over long distances.</p>
                    <p>There were issues with this system, however, as the messages were not very private, being visible to anybody nearby with a telescope. They were also very physically demanding to operate, especially as words were sent whole and not abbreviated for speed.</p>

                    <p>Strangely enough, this system was actually used to catch a murderer! John Tawell, a suspect of the murder of Sarah Hart, boarded a train from Slough to Paddington. Police warned railway officers in Paddington via the telegraph and he was caught shortly afterwards.</p>
